          <h1>HTML5 Markup</h1>
          <p>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages.
            It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
            which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.

          <h1>CSS3 Styling</h1>
          <p>
            CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1.
            It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or
            animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.
            Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments,
            or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.

          <h1>Web Design</h1>
          <p>
            Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a
            collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors,
            text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features
            that deliver pages to your site visitors.
